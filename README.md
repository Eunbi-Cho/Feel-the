## 🪐 Feel the Gravity
It is a work that allows you to form gravity around your fingers when the ball is falling. The Sprite kit provided physical gravity to the ball.

## 👂 Feel the Sound
When you get close to the phone it cries out to get closer, but it whispers quietly to stay away when you go closer to it. It is a work that expresses the sound of distance in a witty way. I used the Proximity Sensor to output the sound according to the Bool value of the Proximity State.

## 👀 Feel the Light
A touch becomes a light in a dark space. It gives the feeling of grasping the space with a small light in the blacked out room. The audience can think about the meaning of light through the experience of finding the exit with their fingers. Using ZStack, SpriteNode was placed on a black background, and black letters were placed on it.
